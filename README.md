## About the Project 📂
This is a simple JavaScript application to generate QR Code for any given data or website URL. Using QR codes is a great way to streamline the user experience and ensure customers can access information as quickly and efficiently as possible. I have used api.qrserver.com Api for the implementation of this project.
